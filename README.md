# Secret Auction Program (Python)

A simple Python project that simulates a **secret auction system** where multiple users can place bids, and the program determines the highest bidder.

This project is built using basic Python concepts like:
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- User Input

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. The program asks each participant for:
   - Name
   - Bid amount
2. After each entry, it asks if there are more bidders.
3. If yes, the screen clears (simulated using blank lines).
4. When no more bidders remain, the program:
   - Finds the highest bid
   - Displays the winner

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python dictionaries
- Functions
- While loops
- Conditional statements

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python secret_auction.py

---

What is your name: Prem
What is your bid $: 300
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no: yes

What is your name: Rahul
What is your bid $: 500
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no: no

The winner of this auction is Rahul with highest bid of $ 500
